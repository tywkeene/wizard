Coins:
    Steel Coin - Least valuable (Valuable to elves)
                 An old currency, some kingdoms do not accept it
                 (Steel is used in some Gnome dominated kingdoms to
                 create machinery, therefor its use as a currency is
                 illegal. Most merchants will sieze this currency for
                 a reward)
